To get Django channels going, install all 3:

$ pip install channels (or pip3)
$ sudo apt-get install redis
$ pip install channels_redis (or pip3)

Redis version 5 and above should definitely work, 
but first test out redis using:

$ redis-cli ping
PONG (should get this as a response)

$ redis-server
This will start redis and show its version, at first 
I had to start redis and keep it up in another terminal 
whenever I needed to use channels, but now I don't need 
to do that, I'm not sure why.

I had to update my redis to Redis 6.2.6 (00000000/0) 64 bit
(I had an error resolving some 'BZPOPMIN' before updating)
To get a more recent version of redis: 

$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:redislabs/redis
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install redis

That should be it, just run everything like normal.
