## Introduction
Our project is a web application version of the card game Codenames. 
In this game, there are two teams, Red and Blue, each of which has two types of players: Spymasters and Operatives.
There are also a set of cards with words on them. Some of the cards are associated with the Red team, others to the Blue team, 
some aren't associated with either (neutral cards), and there is a single Assassain card.
Spymasters are aware of the classifications of the cards, while Operatives do not. The Spymaster must provide their Operatives with a single-word clue,
when it is their team's turn, that will help their teammember identify a card associated with their respective team.
The first team to get all of their cards wins. A team can also win if the opposing team player chose the Assassain card when it was their turn.


## Features and Information
Upon landing on our site the user will be presented with three options:
1. Create new game room
2. Join existing game room (by prodiving a game room code)
3. Get help/information on how the game is played

Following this users will be prompted to pick a screen name, team (red or blue), and role (spymaster or operative). After this the user is added to a game room.

Once there are enough players in the game room, the round will commence. The computer will randomly determine which team will play first. 

The Spymaster of the chosen team will provide the Operative from their team with a single-word clue to help them figure out which card belongs to their team. 
The Spymaster can also specify the number of cards their clue applies to. If the team member guesses correctly,
